## Description
bf-translator - Brainfuck language interpreter and translator to DOS MASM assembler.  
Generates `.ASM` files, needs to be compiled by MASM.  
Tested on programs from http://brainfuck.org/ with MASM 6.11 in DOSBox.  
WIRTTEN FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.  
Stability and correctness are not guaranteed.  

## Usage
First argument is brainfuck file, second is output `.asm` file.  
If no second argument provided, the brainfuck program is interpreted.  

## Known issues
1. When `Enter` key is pressed on Windows, the terminal sends `\n` to program, but DOS sends `\c`. Because many brainfuck programs use `\n`, you can send it by typing `ALT+10`(numbers on numpad).
2. By default many terminals are running in `canonical` mode, but this translator is using direct key input from DOS (`mov ah, 01h`, `int 21h`). This causes not pretty output.
