# Basic implementation of General Problem Solver algorithm

Key features:
- Written in Haskell in less than 50 LOC.
- Abstract. You can have different types for operations and goals.

Warning:
- It is not tested.
- It does not fix problems like clobbered sibling problem, or recursive subgoal problem, etc.
